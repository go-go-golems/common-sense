# This represents the layout of a form to edit plant objects.
# A layout is separated in sections, which then has rows.
# Each actual editing element is represented as an input.
# Inputs have name, type, target. 
# List fields have a parent-table, as they are stored in different tables and joined through an id/parent_id.
# The target is the name of a table followed by the name of a field.
